> **Open Source Software Compliance & Code Intelligence Platform**

Welcome to SemClone, the organization behind **SEMCL.ONE** - an enterprise-grade platform for comprehensive code similarity detection, license compliance, and OSS risk management.

## About SEMCL.ONE

SEMCL.ONE is a complete ecosystem of specialized tools designed to help organizations manage open source software compliance, detect code similarities, and assess security risks across their software supply chain.

### Mission
Empowering developers and organizations with intelligent tools for:
- **Code Pattern Detection** - Advanced semantic analysis for similarity detection
- **License Compliance** - Automated identification and management of OSS licenses
- **Supply Chain Security** - Risk assessment and vulnerability analysis
- **Legal Documentation** - Automated generation of compliance notices and reports

## Platform Architecture

### Core Analysis Pipeline
```
Source Input → Package Resolution → Code Analysis → License Detection → Risk Assessment → Compliance Reports
```

## Component Ecosystem

### Package & Source Management

- **[src2purl](https://github.com/SemClone/src2purl)** - Identifies package coordinates from source code using SWHIDs and multiple strategies
- **[upmex](https://github.com/SemClone/upmex)** - Universal package metadata extractor supporting 13 package ecosystems

### Code & Binary Analysis
- **[binarysniffer](https://github.com/SemClone/binarysniffer)** - Identifies hidden OSS components embedded in binary files through signature matching
- **Code Miner** - Extracts code patterns and performs semantic analysis for similarity detection *(Private Beta)*

### License & Compliance
